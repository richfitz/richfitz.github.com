	<h1>About my research</h1>

        <p>
          I am a computational biologist - I address longstanding
          biological questions by developing new techniques.
          Currently my research follows two complementary strands:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Understanding variation in the tree of life.  I develop
            and apply statistical approaches to understand why the
            tree of life is so uneven: some groups of species are far
            more diverse than others, and species traits are unevenly
            distributed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Understanding the processes that generate and maintain
            diversity.  I am using mathematical and simulation
            approaches to understand the processes that prevent a
            "single winner" dominanting ecosystems.
          </li>
        </ol>

          We tried to answer the simple question of what fraction of
          the world's plant species are woody: surprising the answer
          to this is not known.  We surveyed researchers and found a
          huge range of estimates.  We used a trait database that
          spanned 12% of plant diversity, and found that due to
          taxonomic patterns of woodiness, the estimates of woodiness
          were extremely biased.  We used Monte Carlo (sampling)
          methods to correct this bias and found that just under half
          the world's vascular plant species are woody.  Surprisingly
          this was much higher than estimates from researchers, even
          with significant botanical training.

          This is the companion paper to my package <a
          href="http://www.zoology.ubc.ca/prog/diversitree">diversitree</a>.
          This paper outlines the overall design goals of the package.
          I introduce a new method, "MuSSE", for partitioning the
          effects that multiple traits may have on diversification.  I
          also describe two new algorithms for fitting evolutionary
          models: a linear time algorithm for fitting continuous trait
          models based on Brownian Motion (always faster than the
          traditional cubic-time algorithm based on covariance
          matrices) and for fitting discrete traits with many levels
          (linear in the number of levels, rather than quadratic or
          worse).

        <h2>Quantitative traits and diversification</h2>

        <p class="ref">Systematic Biology, 2010. doi:<a href="http://doi.org/10.1093/sysbio/syq053">10.1093/sysbio/syq053</a></p>

          I develop a new method, QuaSSE, to infer the effect of
          continuous traits such as body size on speciation and
          extinction rates, while simultaneously modelling the
          evolution of these traits.  I show that under ideal
          situations with simulated data, the methods can infer
          patterns of diversification deep in the past, even while
          using only extant species data.  I tested a long-standing
          hypothesis that species tend to become larger in size while
          large species diversify less rapidly than smaller species
          using a tree of all primates: I found little support for
          this hypothesis.

          In this paper I present ideas, algorithms and code for
          detecting the effect of species traits on rates of
          speciation and extinction.  This generalised a new method
          (BiSSE) where only part of the structure of the phylogeny is
          known.  This relaxes key assumptions in the original method
          and allowed BiSSE to be used on much broader classes of data
          than was previously possible.
